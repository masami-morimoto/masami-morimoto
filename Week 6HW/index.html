        <p> My midterm project would be a web site about koto, a Japanese national instrument.  Although this is a national instrument of Japan,  not so many people play it and sadly our koto industry is shrinking.  I play the instrument since I was a young girl, and I would like to introduce and share my favorite music with you.

In the website, I would like to include a little bit of history, about the instrument,  how to read koto music score, and showing a video how to play the instrument, I would add photos as well as music. I hope this proposal for my midterm project would be acceptable. I am very much looking forward to work on it!
